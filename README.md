**code-soup is the python code for the book "Adversarial Deep Learning" and its tutorials. You can use this in conjunction with a course on Adversarial Deep Learning, or for study on your own. We're looking for solid contributors to help.**

Despite the great success of deep neural networks in a wide range of applications, they have been repeatedly shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. *Adversarial Deep Learning* is a book being written by [Dr. Di Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x5QTK9YAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Yifang Yin](https://yifangyin.github.io/), [Yaman Kumar](https://sites.google.com/view/yaman-kumar/), and [Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn), which gives the reader an introduction to the progress made in this field. At code-soup we are building the codebase of these algorithms in a *clean, simple and minimal* manner . We strive to give the reader a smooth experience while reading the book and understanding the code in parallel with a minimal set of dependencies and library. Contact of the core developers can be seen in [AUTHORS](./AUTHORS.md).

## Requirements
The requirements are stored in `requirements.txt` you can install them using
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We recommend to use a virtual environment, the exported yaml is available at `environment.yml`.

## Tutorials
The tutorial to each algorithm is available in the Tutorials folder.
